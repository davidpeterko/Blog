                <p>Been working on my portfolioâ€¦ and it reminds me that I really need to learn better CSS. My portfolio is so minimalistic haha. Well anyway, just finally completed my resume, now I just gotta make a direct link for it on my portfolio front page. Oh! Also found a nice Jekyll theme for my blog, woot! If you like this theme, go ahead and head over to <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/metaphor/">this link</a>. An old friend from UT also let me know there was a <em>POSSIBLE</em> job opening over at WP Engine! So, I shot my resume over and got a response back to apply over at a link they sent me in an email. <em>Fingers</em> <em>crossed</em>. Time to do some late night PHP learning! Cheers my precious readers.</p>

                <p>Overall, this class was very difficult, but WORTH IT. For any future student reading this, if you are looking for an easy class to blow off, this is not it. This class requires effort and correctness. The projects are very thorough and test your knowledge on the material taught in class. I would not recommend taking this class with another code heavy class like CS439/429. I took this during the summer and each project (after the first 2) took around 20-30 hours to complete, and another 5-10 hours to debug and complete the rest of the project requirements. He incorporates alot fo good and useful tools that are used in the real world such as: Google Test, valgrind (memory checker), gcov (coverage check), and Travis CI (continuous integration). </p>

                <p>This week has bneen very interesting! But tough nonetheless. It started with a very unlucky choice in a partner for project 3 which I had explained in my previous blog post. Because I was not careful with how the course is structured with how projects are graded, I had assumed that I would recieve pointed for the other things if our Mersenne prime did not output correctly. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Thankfully, Downing was nice enough to give me a 24 extension from the time I turned in Deque to try and complete it and get it turned it again for a 1 day late penalty. So this week we had to do project 4 whihc was Deque.h. For all the people who bother reading this out there for future takers of this class, Integer and Deque are extremely hard and require ALOT of time and planning; how the class actually works, how to manipulate the underlying containers and how you want to structure your code (private variables, iterators etc.).</p>

                <p>So this week has been very hectic again. With my first session class just finishing up this past friday as well at an incredibly hard project 3 Integer for this class <generic>. I barely had anytime to relax or sleep. So this weekend I have been catching up on sleep, and just started working on this project 4 for generic today. We got TestDeque.c++ completed; basically jsut some good edge cases for me to test against when me and my partner are writing Deque.h. Though the project doesnt seem HARD, it seems like it does require alot of understanding of how the container works underneath. Which will be a task, but luckily I have been slowly getting it by reading it in the textbook and with the online reference that another student posted on piazza. </generic></p>

                <p>So, we had gotten exam #1 back this week on canvas. I did a little worse than i expected. While doing project 3, I realized somethings about interators and containers that I didnt know before. I think that having the exam after this project wouldve been very helpful to understandign the test material since the test was soley based on containers and its iterators. But in the end, the test also helped prepare us for project 3 in a way.</p>

                <p>So this week is the week leading up to the first test which makes me very nervous. I have been studying Saturday and some today and I will continue to study after I make this blog post. The test is entirely made of up coding C++ as Downing has told us. My study strategy is to study with a group of people so you can all throw the knowledge you know to each other and bounce off ideas and work on problems together. Reading the book sections also is a good idea which I havent gotten around to, but I will later tonight. Working problems and reviewing the code on GitHUb (copy.c++ and etc) is very helpful. I have a feeling he will be putting a question on writing a iterator and its functions. I have not yet worked through the Prime problem he has given us but I will. Running code and checking output is a great way of understanding how C++ functions work; especially pointers and referencing!</p>

                <p>This week we went over several different c++ files with different functionalities. We went over some STL iterators and which one of these is best for which situations. Sadly, this week was filled with alot of rainy weather, so I attened Monday and Friday and skipped Wednesday using 1 out of 5 of my unexcused absences. A good tip for this week is to pay attention to pointers how they are called, addressed, and referenced. My last time dealing with pointers on an entensive level was when I was taking CS439 which was Operating Systems. </p>

                <p>The first full week of Generic Programming &amp; The STL was alot better than I had imagined. When I had first signed up for the class, I had googled reviews about Professor Downing and two classes game up: Generic Programming and Software Engineering. Half of the results were blogs relating to the class and some were made on word press and some were made on tumblr, so it seems that the blog feature for bonus points had been long running since before this summerâ€™s class; it does seem though that he had made the switch over to Github Pages using Jekyll, which in my opinion was a bit confusing to set up but with some help from Jekyll documentation and youtube videos I finally got it set up and working. </p>
