Been working on my portfolio... and it reminds me that I really need to learn better CSS. My portfolio is so minimalistic haha. Well anyway, just finally completed my resume, now I just gotta make a direct link for it on my portfolio front page. Oh! Also found a nice Jekyll theme for my blog, woot! If you like this theme, go ahead and head over to [this link](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/metaphor/). An old friend from UT also let me know there was a _POSSIBLE_ job opening over at WP Engine! So, I shot my resume over and got a response back to apply over at a link they sent me in an email. _Fingers_ _crossed_. Time to do some late night PHP learning! Cheers my precious readers.

A jekyll and github pages tutorial will be up soon within the next week!
